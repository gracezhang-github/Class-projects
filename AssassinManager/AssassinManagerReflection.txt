Assesement 3: AssassinManager Reflection

1) What did you learn from working on this 
assignment?

What I learned from working on this assignment
is that the jGrasp visual debugger is really helpful
at visualizing list nodes. For example, when I was 
trying to determine who was stalking who, the debugger
was really helpful in showing me whether if my code
was doing what I wanted it to.

2) What did you struggle most with on this 
assignment? How did you work to overcome 
that struggle (even if you weren't able to)?

What I struggled most with on this assignment
was the kill method. I worked to overcome that struggle
through revisiting previous lessons and section problems.
When I was stuck on a bug, I also made great use of the 
jGrasp debugger, which really helped alleviate some confusion

3) How will you use what you learned from 
this assignment to improve your process or 
approach on future assignments?

I will use what I learned from this assignment
to improve my process on future assignments
in that I will use the jGrasp debugger to 
visualize my code, additionally, before I start
my assessment, I should practice first through
section problems.

4) Was any part of the specification or 
requirements unclear? If so, what part(s), 
and how could it have been made clearer?

No, the specification and requirements were
pretty clear.

5) About how many hours did you spend working 
on this assignment? (Estimates are fine, but 
try to get close)

20-30hrs
